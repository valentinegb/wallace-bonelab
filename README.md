# Wallace Bonelab Mod Repository
This repository exists for two reasons:

 1. To backup the project in case something happens to my computer
 2. So that you may download the project and pack the pallet yourself, if you need to

## So how do I do the latter?
To avoid giving information that may be non-specific, innacurate, or may go out of date (and also because I'm lazy) please read the [MarrowSDK documentation](https://github.com/StressLevelZero/MarrowSDK/wiki). [This page in particular](https://github.com/StressLevelZero/MarrowSDK/wiki/BuildPallet) is specifically about pallet packing.
